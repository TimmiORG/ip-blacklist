IP Blacklist

automatic generated IP blacklist for our OPNsense firewall.
List will be updated every 12h.

Duplicates and all blocked Subnets have been removed from the input lists.

whitelist contains the list of IPs to removed from the blacklists
blacklist is used to manually add IPs to the public lists

all.list.use is the final result of all the filtering. ;)
